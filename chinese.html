        <img src="images/tandoori-chicken.webp" alt="" />
        <p>
          Tandoori Chicken is a popular Indian dish where chicken pieces are
          marinated in yogurt and a blend of spices, including cumin, coriander,
          turmeric, and chili powder. The marinated chicken is traditionally
          cooked in a tandoor, a clay oven that gives it a characteristic smoky
          flavor and a slightly crispy exterior. The yogurt in the marinade
          helps tenderize the chicken, while the spices add layers of aromatic
          flavor. Tandoori Chicken is often served with mint chutney and onion
          rings as a starter or main course, and it's enjoyed for its vibrant
          color and bold taste.
