          Chiles en Nogada is a celebrated Mexican dish featuring poblano chiles stuffed with a flavorful picadillo mixture of meat, fruits, and spices. The chiles are then covered in a rich, creamy walnut sauce (nogada) made with ground walnuts, milk, and queso fresco. The dish is traditionally garnished with pomegranate seeds, which add a burst of color and contrasting texture. Chiles en Nogada is known for its symbolic representation of the Mexican flag's colors and is enjoyed during festive occasions, particularly around Mexico's Independence Day. It combines savory, sweet, and nutty flavors in a delightful culinary experience.
