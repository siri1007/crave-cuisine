          Biryani is a classic South Asian dish known for its fragrant basmati
          rice layered with marinated meat or vegetables and a blend of aromatic
          spices. The meat, often chicken, mutton, or fish, is marinated in
          yogurt and spices before being cooked with partially cooked rice. The
          dish is typically prepared using a slow-cooking method known as dum,
          where the pot is sealed to allow flavors to infuse. Biryani is enjoyed
          with accompaniments like raita (yogurt sauce) and salad, making it a
          beloved and elaborate dish for special occasions and gatherings.

        <p>
          Masala Dosa is a popular South Indian dish consisting of a thin,
          crispy crepe made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black
          gram lentils). The dosa is spread thinly on a hot griddle and cooked
          until golden brown and crispy. Inside, it's typically filled with a
          spiced potato filling made from boiled potatoes seasoned with mustard
          seeds, turmeric, curry leaves, and sometimes onions and green chilies.

        <p>
          Tandoori Chicken is a popular Indian dish where chicken pieces are
          marinated in yogurt and a blend of spices, including cumin, coriander,
          turmeric, and chili powder. The marinated chicken is traditionally
          cooked in a tandoor, a clay oven that gives it a characteristic smoky
          flavor and a slightly crispy exterior. The yogurt in the marinade
          helps tenderize the chicken, while the spices add layers of aromatic
          flavor. Tandoori Chicken is often served with mint chutney and onion
          rings as a starter or main course, and it's enjoyed for its vibrant
          color and bold taste.

      <h1>Butter Chicken</h1>

        <img src="images/butter-chicken.webp" alt="" />
        <p>
          Butter Chicken, or Murgh Makhani, is a quintessential North Indian
          dish known for its creamy texture and rich flavors. Marinated chicken
          is traditionally cooked in a tandoor, imparting a smoky flavor. The
          sauce is made from tomatoes, butter, cream, and spices like fenugreek
          leaves, creating a velvety base with a hint of sweetness. Once cooked,
          the chicken is simmered in this sauce until tender, resulting in a
          dish that's both comforting and indulgent. It's often served with naan
          or rice, making it a popular choice in Indian cuisine.
